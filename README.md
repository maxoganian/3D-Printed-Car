# 3D-Printed-Car

A small robotic car using 3D printed parts.

## Intro

This project is a robotic car that can be 3D printed on the Micro 3D Printer from M3D. This car was printed with M3D's tough and ABS-R filement. The software runs on an Arduino MKR1000. The car is controlled through the blynk app over wifi. The Blynk app communicates over WiFi with the MKR1000.

## 3D Printing
Here is the 3D printer with custom feeder for the filament:

For this project everthing was printed on M3D's Micro printer. I used M3D's Tough and ABS-R filement for all of the prints. While the filement is fantastic I can not recomend the Micro 3D printer. All of the CAD files include a tolerance of about .2 inches. All of the CAD drawings were done in Fusion 360. I print onto painters tape. The printers setting that I use can be found here:
